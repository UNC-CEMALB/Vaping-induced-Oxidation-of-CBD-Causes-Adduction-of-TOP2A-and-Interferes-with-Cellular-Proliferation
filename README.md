# CBD_CBDQ_16HBE_RNA-SeqAnalysis
- Using DESeq2 to determine differentially expressed genes after varying CBD products (control, cannabidiol (CBD) and reactive electrophile CBD quinone(CBDQ)) across two exposure durations (ie. 12 and 24 hours)
- Creating heatmap of genes that were significantly different
- Creating a venn diagram to determine genes that were signficantly altered in multiple exposure groups

# VapedCBD_HBEC_RNA-SeqAnalysis
- Using DESeq2 to determine differentially expressed genes after varying vaped CBD products (apical CBD, CBD juice, and CBD oil) after 20 puffs of exposure
- Creating heatmap of genes that were significantly different
- Creating a venn diagram to determine genes that were signficantly altered in multiple exposure groups
