> The goal of this paper was to measure the presensce of reactive electrophile CBD quinone(CBDQ) in commercial CBD vapes. Additionally, the effects of these chemical profiles on the transcriptome in human epithelial cells was investigated as a proxy for respiratory function. 

# CBD_CBDQ_16HBE_RNA-SeqAnalysis
- Using DESeq2 to determine differentially expressed genes after varying CBD products (control, cannabidiol (CBD) and CBDQ) across two exposure durations (ie. 12 and 24 hours)
- Creating heatmap of genes that were significantly different
- Creating a venn diagram to determine genes that were signficantly altered in multiple exposure groups

# VapedCBD_HBEC_RNA-SeqAnalysis
- Using DESeq2 to determine differentially expressed genes after varying vaped CBD products (apical CBD, CBD juice, and CBD oil) after 20 puffs of exposure
- Creating heatmap of genes that were significantly different
- Creating a venn diagram to determine genes that were signficantly altered in multiple exposure groups
